# Computing the Riemann Zeta function & its fractals
This was the title of my final year maths project.
Havent looked at this code for almost 7 years!
I did further studying on fractal geometry & complex numbers
back in July 2015. 
Fractal geometry can be used often to descibe the geometry or shape of features
found throughout nature
including the coastlines of countries, the shape of galaxies, the structure of snowflakes & trees etc.
Basically its a pattern which just repeats itself on smaller & smaller scales. 

The Mandelbrot set is one of the most famous examples of a fractal. The images you see below are approximations
& show the increase in detail as the variable `loops` increases 


### The following images show the increase in detail of the set as the variable `loops` increases from 5, to 10 & 100 respectively

## Wins & challenges
- I achieved a first with regards to maths
- The code is very inefficient & needs improving 
## Improvements needed
- Will rewrite this in a Django app
- There are too many for loops which increases the run time exponentially?
- Optimisation/Memoization might be needed
