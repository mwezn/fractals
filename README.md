# Computing the Riemann Zeta function & its fractals
This was the title of my final year maths project
I done research into fractal geometry & complex numbers
back in July 2015. 
which included the Mandelbrot set. The image you see below is an approximation
UPDATE: First time looking at this code in 7 years!

## Wins & challenges
- I acheived a first with regards to maths
- The code is very inefficient & needs improving 
- There are too many for loops which increases the run time exponentially?
